Here are specifications for building a simple online ROM calculator web app based on this documentation:

## Application Overview

**Purpose:** A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimator for GenAI project setup and implementation expenses.

## User Interface Requirements

### Input Fields

- **Scenario Name:** Text input for labeling the estimate
- **Scope:** Dropdown with options: Small (1–2 workflows), Medium (3–4 workflows), Large (5+ workflows)
- **Integrations:** Dropdown with options: Few (0–1 systems), Some (2–3 systems), Many (4+ systems)
- **Data Complexity:** Dropdown with options: Low (clean docs, minimal PII), Medium (multiple sources, some PII), High (many sources, sensitive data)
- **Security & Compliance:** Dropdown with options: Basic (internal pilot), Standard (SSO, logging, filtering), Strict (regulated, red-team, audits)
- **Team Approach:** Dropdown with options: In-house, Mixed, Partner-led
- **Model Approach:** Dropdown with options: API-only, Light tuning, Fine-tuning
- **Base Cost:** Number input in USD thousands (e.g., 150 = $150,000)

### Calculation Logic

Apply multipliers based on selections:

- Scope: Small=1.0, Medium=1.1, Large=1.25
- Integration: Few=1.0, Some=1.1, Many=1.25
- Data: Low=1.0, Medium=1.2, High=1.5
- Security: Basic=1.0, Standard=1.1, Strict=1.3
- Team: In-house=0.9, Mixed=1.0, Partner-led=1.15
- Model: API-only=1.0, Light tuning=1.15, Fine-tuning=1.35

### Output Display

- **Most-likely:** Base × all factors
- **Low estimate:** Most-likely × 0.8
- **High estimate:** Most-likely × 1.3

## Technical Stack Suggestions

- **Frontend:** React or Vue.js with form validation
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for clean dropdowns and outputs
- **State Management:** React hooks or Vuex for real-time calculation
- **Backend (optional):** Can be entirely client-side; add Node.js/Express if you want to save scenarios

## Features

- Real-time calculation as users adjust inputs
- Ability to save and compare multiple scenarios
- Export results as PDF or CSV
- Tooltips explaining each input option
